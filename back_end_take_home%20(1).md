SomeCompany Back End Engineer Evaluation
======

This programming challenge is used to evaluate engineering candidates. It is designed to take two hours to complete. The overall goal is to connect to a SomeCompany secure server and retrieve an image. Once this image is downloaded a checksum algorithm will need to be developed and ran against this image. Finally some questions are asked about this method of image validation. 

In order to connect to the SomeCompany servers our auth protocol must be implemented. See section *Implementing Auth* below. After auth signatures are successfully generated the code should utilize our REST API for image retrieval. See section *Retrieving TryOn’s From SomeCompany Servers* below. Finally once an image is retrieved a checksum algorithm must be developed. 

To assist in the evaluation the following information should be used:
* `some_id` = `user_ping_test`
* `product_id` = `someProduct_Id`
* `host_name` = `vto-sandbox.playground.api.SomeCompany.com`
* `access_key_id` = `someAcccessKey`
* `secret_key` = `someSecret_Key`

#### Step 1: Implement Auth

SomeCompany Authentication and Authorization protocol utilizes a HMAC-SHA-512 hash generated with a message that contains a timestamp for time limited signature. The steps to generate the signature are below:
1. `timestamp`: 
The timestamp is seconds since unix utc epoch or the seconds since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC
2. `message`: 
The message should be a combination of `some_id` and the `timestamp` combined with a `.` as a separator. E.g. `some_id.1232345234`.
3. `hash`: 
A HMAC-SHA-512 hash is generated by using both the `message` and a secret key. The `secret_key` is a hex string and must be converted to the binary data it represents in order to be used by HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm. The resulting hash must then be converted into a _URL safe base64 string_ with the padding `=` at the end be removed.
5. Signature: 
The `signature` is a string combining the `message` and `hash` with `.` as a separator. E.g. `some_id.1232345234.hash`
6. Request Headers:
All the future REST calls require the auth `signature` and `access_key_id` be passed in via the headers of the request as shown below:
> X-SomeCompany-Access-Key-Id: `access_key_id`
> X-SomeCompany-Signature: `signature`

#### Step 2: Retrieving Image From SomeCompany Servers

SomeCompany's server requires an image number to be requested and parsed from the JSON returned during the HTTP GET request on the `SomeCompanys` endpoint:
> https://`host_name`/api/1.3/SomeCompanys/`some_id`

Once a image number is determined a REST GET call to strip can be made to request an image at 
> https://`host_name`/api/1.3/SomeCompanys/`some_id`/strip/?product_id=`product_id`&frames=`image_num`

Save this image for submission of your work later. 

#### Step 3: Implementing a Checksum

The idea of a “checksum” is to produce a unique value for a given object, that can later be used to detect errors or malfeasance. We would like you to implement a simplified “checksum” algorithm. Please produce code that computes the sum of all pixel intensity values for each of the RGB channels of the image. This should result in a single summed number. 

#### Step 4: Submitting Your Work

To finish this test please reply to the email with the image downloaded, the code generated, and following questions answered:

* What was the value of the calculated checksum?
* What happens to the calculated checksum if the image is sufficiently large?
* Is it a good idea to run the JPEG compression multiple times to attempt to make the image size smaller? 
 * Could the checksum of a repeatedly compressed image still be used against the original?
